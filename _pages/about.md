<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm a ph.D candidate from Tongji University[School of EECS](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Junfeng Yin of Kay Laboratory of Intelligent Computing and Applications, Ministry of Education. 

You can find my CV here: [NanLi's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV_nli_en.pdf).

My research interest includes Numerical Linear Algebra, Complementarity Problems, Randomized Algorithms and Option Pricing.
